# Bike Share Program Proposal
## The Data
### User Demographics
We looked at data from the NYC CitiBike bike share program in order to gauge the viability of a similar program in Des Moines. 
We were able to determine the following:
* Subscribers are by far the largest user group.
* Men in their late 30's to early 40's are the largest user demographic
* The busiest use times are focused around the normal business commuting hours

### What that means
The target user group are professionals who use mass transit to get into the city. Then they utlize the bike share program for their "last mile." The average use time was concentrated arount the 4-7 minute mark, which means that the most common users are not tourists looking for a sight seeing ride across town.
Making sure that our bike stations are located in high mass transit traffic areas will lead to increased ridership.

## Locations, Usage, and Service
### Bike Stations
Making sure that our bike stations are close to mass transit hubs will ensure that we catch the eye of prople that want to efficiently get from the train or bus stop to the office. The busiest starting locations are usually also  the busiest trip end locations. Throughout the day as the bikes disperse it will become difficult to round up any units in need of service from points unknown. 
### Service Locations
Our service center(s) should be located as close as possible to the busiest pick up and drop off areas. That way we can ensure a steady supply of bikes, that are in good operating condition with the minimum number of trips required to gather the bikes up.
